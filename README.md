# WordSolver

(Note: This Readme file and the mini program is a work in progress, it may contain lots of bugs. The code may be badly optimized as well. Use it at your own risk)

Short info about the author: I started learning Python a while ago, trying to improve myself by programming random stuff to gain deeper experience/understanding about the different usages of Python.

1. Introduction

WordSolver (aka kevinj93 word generator) is a python based command-line word solver which allows you to generate valid words by checking and comparing the randomly generated results with a text file full of words (Any European Language should work, Unicode characters not tested).

2. Usage Instructions:

1. Start the program, follow the prompt
2. Put any number of characters you like (The bigger the slower) 
   (Special Characters and Numbers are filtered out)   
3. Choose how many characters you would like to generate words with.
4. If you would like to continue playing, follow the prompt on the screen
5. After exiting the app. You will get a basic log information about the words you generated, plus a more comprehensive (work in progress)    log file generated by the app in the same dir of the app. 

3. Suggestions/Improvements?
