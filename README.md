# WordSolver

(Note: This Readme file and the mini program is a work in progress, it may contain lots of bugs. The code may be badly optimized as well. Use it at your own risk)

Short info about the author: I started learning Python a while ago, trying to improve myself by programming random stuff to gain deeper experience/understanding about the different usages of Python.

1. Introduction

WordSolver (aka kevinj93 word generator) is a python based command-line word solver which allows you to generate valid words by checking and comparing the randomly generated results with a text file full of words (Any European Language should work, Unicode characters not tested).

2. Usage Instructions:

   * Start the program, follow the prompt
   * Put any number of characters you like (The bigger the slower) 
      (Special Characters and Numbers are filtered out)   
   * Choose how many characters you would like to generate words with.
   * If you would like to continue playing, follow the prompt on the screen
   * After exiting the app. You will get a basic log information about the words you generated, plus a more comprehensive (work in             progress) log file generated by the app in the same dir of the app. 
   * words.txt file can be used as an example for a list of english words. Although it's not 100% accurate but it does the job pretty          well.
